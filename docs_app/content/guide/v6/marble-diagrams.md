# Marble diagrams

To explain how operators work, textual descriptions are often not enough. Many operators are related to time. Diagrams are often a better tool for that. _Marble Diagrams_ are visual representations of how operators work, and include the input Observable(s), the operator and its parameters, and the output Observable.

<span class="informal">In a marble diagram, time flows to the right, and the diagram describes how values ("marbles") are emitted on the Observable execution.</span>

Below you can see the anatomy of a marble diagram.

Throughout this documentation site, we extensively use marble diagrams to explain how operators work. They may be really useful in other contexts too, like on a whiteboard or even in our unit tests (as ASCII diagrams).
